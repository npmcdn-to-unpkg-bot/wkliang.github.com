	Mixing HTML and JavaScript makes it harder for multiple
	specialists to work together on a piece of code, and inline
	JavaScript introduces the risk of code duplication.
	Most important of all, mixing HTML and JavaScript creates a performance
	penalty during rendering. Every tiime the browser encounters a piece of
	JavaScript, it pauses the rendering process to interpret the JavaScript
	code. The penalty grows as the size of the JavaScript code increases.

        <p>Selecting Pseudo-Elemtns<br/> The first question you should ask is, What is the difference between a pseudo-element and a pseudo-class, and why are the different?
	A pseudo-class leaves the element intact and provides an extra property (class) to the element in order to style the full element. In most case, this helps to render interactivity without requiring JavaScript code.
	A pseudo-element applies only to part of the element and not to the full element. Pseudo-elements act as if they are child elements of the real element. <br/>
